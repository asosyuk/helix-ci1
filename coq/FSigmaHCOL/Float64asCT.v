  (* For "regular" floating point numbers the comparison is
    straighforward. However we need to handle NaNs. From point of
    view of DHCOL<->FHCOL semantics equivalence, NaNs does not matter,
    as we are going to constant the proof to input data which does not
    contain NaNs and furthermore prove that NaNs will not appear as
    result of any internal computations. So any NaN behaviour will do.

    To simplify FHCOL->IR compiler proofs we will chose to handle NaNs
    as similiar as possible as it is done in [fcmp olt] instruction
    which this one is compiled to. Per IR spec it "yields true if both
    operands are not a QNAN and op1 is less than op2"
