This development reflects authors' Coq learning journey and contains a
lot of inelegant and redundant code. Additionally, it includes some
workarounds for bugs and limitations for older Coq versions (starting
from 8.4).

It is overdue for serious refactoring and cleanup. Amongst other things:

* Refactoring
** Some other cleanup opportunities are marked with "TODO" comments
** Many usused definitions could be removed. (Hint: try `make print-unused`)
** Rename implementations with ' suffux into "_Impl" in /SigmaHCOLImpl.v/.
  For example =eT'= should become =eTImpl=

* Proof mechanics
** Review `_arg_proper` vs `_proper` instances
** Proof-irrelevance assumption could be avoided
* Unfinished
** Automate /DynWin/ rewriting proof
** Automate SPIRAL log reading for sequence of rewrites
   Perhaps using TemplateCoq?
