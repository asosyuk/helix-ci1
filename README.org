* HELIX

[[https://travis-ci.com/vzaliva/helix][https://travis-ci.com/vzaliva/helix.svg?token=x87izvm44MdTPLHzuxzF&branch=master]]

HELIX project allows for the synthesis of high-performance implementations of numerical 
algorithms by providing a certified compiler for formally-specified DSL. 
Based on the existing [[http://spiral.net/][SPIRAL]] system, HELIX adds
the rigor of formal verification of its correctness using the Coq
proof assistant. It formally defines a series of domain-specific
languages starting with HCOL, which represents a computation data
flow. HELIX works by transforming the original program through a
series of intermediate languages, culminating in LLVM IR.

- HELIX focuses on automatic translation a class of mathematical.
  expressions to code.
- It works by revealing implicit iteration constructs and re-shaping
  them to match target platform parallelizm and vectorization
  capabilities.
- HELIX is rigorously defined and formally verified.
- HELIX is implemented in Coq proof assistant.
- It supports non-linear operators.
- Presently, HELIX uses SPIRAL as an optimization oracle, but it
  certifies its findings.
- LLVM is used machine code generation backend.
- Main application: Cyber-physical systems.

** Bulding and Running 
*** Install VELLVM dependency:

    You need to manually check out /master/ branch of VELLVM, compile,
    and symlink it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ln -s path_to_vellvm_checkout/vellvm helix/lib
     ln -s path_to_vellvm_checkout/vellvm/src/ml/libvellvm helix/ml
#+END_SRC

*** Build:
    
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     make
#+END_SRC
    
*** Run unit tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     make test
#+END_SRC
